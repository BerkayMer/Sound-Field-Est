#Learning SOund Fields Using Kernels

## Introduction
A repo that uses the functions provided by aspcol to study the kernel and machine learning based sound field interpolation. Functions for the modified approaches along with examples are provided

## Dependencies
[aspcore](https://github.com/SOUNDS-RESEARCH/aspcore) is required for this code to work. The other dependencies are listed in requirements.txt, and can be installed with pip. Some files only work for python version 3.8 or above.

## Acknowledgement
This repository is developed on top of the sound field estimation framework developed by Jesper Brunnstroem.
